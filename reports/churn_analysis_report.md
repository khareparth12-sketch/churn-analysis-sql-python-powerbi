## Executive Summary

This analysis examines customer churn patterns in a telecommunications company using behavioral, contractual, and financial data. The objective was to identify key drivers of churn and high-risk customer segments to support data-driven retention strategies.

The study reveals that early-stage customers on flexible contracts exhibit the highest churn rates, particularly those using electronic check payments and paying mid-to-high monthly charges.

## Key Findings

1. Tenure is the strongest predictor of churn, with customers in their first year showing nearly 48% churn.
2. Month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn compared to long-term contracts.
3. Customers paying between ₹78–₹99 per month show elevated churn rates.
4. The highest-risk segment consists of first-year, month-to-month customers using electronic check payments, with churn exceeding 60%.
5. Long-term contracts (two-year) demonstrate strong customer retention, with churn below 5%.

## Business Interpretation

High churn among early-stage and flexible-contract customers suggests weak initial engagement and low commitment. Elevated churn among electronic check users indicates payment friction and possible dissatisfaction.

Mid-to-high paying customers may experience unmet service expectations, leading to increased attrition. In contrast, long-term contracts promote stability and customer loyalty.

## Recommendations

1. Introduce loyalty incentives and onboarding support during the first 6 months.
2. Promote one-year and two-year contract plans through targeted discounts.
3. Encourage automatic payment methods to reduce billing friction.
4. Implement proactive retention campaigns for customers in the ₹78–₹99 charge range.
5. Develop early-warning systems for high-risk profiles using churn predictors.

## Expected Business Impact

Implementing these strategies is expected to reduce early-stage churn, improve customer lifetime value, and increase long-term revenue stability. Targeted retention efforts can significantly lower acquisition costs and enhance customer satisfaction.
